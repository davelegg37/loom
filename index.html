		<div>Repeat</div>
		<div>The Loom of The Universe</div>
		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>For as long as time Mother Nature and Chance had worked together to weave beautiful and complex tapestries on the Loom of the Universe.  Chance provided the materials which Mother Nature used to weave into her intricate webs of cloth.</div>
		<div>Listen</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>She began with small simple structures, like protons and neutrons, but as the Loom of the Universe  grew and Chance provided her more material the complexity of her work also grew.  First there were atoms which she compressed into stars and then into galaxies. Later she surrounded some of the stars with planets.  It was on one of these little worlds that Mother Nature chose to construct some of her most exquisite creations.</div>
		<div>Mother Nature and Chance worked well together.  Mother Nature sitting at the Loom of the Universe taking each new object Chance brought to her and slowly, painstakingly trying to find the perfect place for it in the pattern she was weaving.  Now, not everything Chance brought her could be fit into the fabric.  Mother Nature had to discard many of the finds Chance brought her because they just didn't fit.</div>
		<div>As the fabric became more complex the search for the perfect fit became harder and more time consuming.  When the loom was small it had taken no time at all to complete a tapestry but as the loom grew larger and the  patterns more intricate, the work went much slower.  This didn't bother Mother Nature or Chance for they had plenty of time.
</div>
		<div>Then one day Chance brought Mother Nature a most interesting object.  He called it a man. As Mother Nature considered the man and where to place it in the web she was constructing, it did the most extraordinary thing.  It spoke to her.
</div>
		<div>"Hey Grandma," the man said, somewhat disrespectfully.  "Let"s get on with it.  Find me a place in this rag you're making and be quick about it."Mother Nature was flabbergasted. Never before had Chance brought her an object that could speak.  Mother Nature's surprise quickly turned to chagrin as she realized how rude and impatient this object was."These things take time," Mother Nature said to the man.  "You will just have to be patient.""Look," said the man. "If you can't work any faster then this, move and let me take over. I can weave this cloth much faster and better then you can."Man took the shuttle from her and said, "I'll show you how to weave cloth and by the way, Chance, I won't be needing you anymore.  I can plan things rationally, thank you very much. ”  With that he shoved Mother Nature from her seat in front of the loom, sat down and began to weave.
</div>
		<div>Man was indeed much faster than Mother Nature at weaving cloth.  The tapestry seemed to fly off the loom and increased even faster as man became more skilled at manipulating the shuttle.
</div>
		<div>After a time, however, man began to notice a problem with the tapestries he was creating. The complex intricacies that had all worked together to produce the harmony of Mother Nature’s designs were not present in his work. Stark  rigid disharmony had replaced the warm organic complexity of Mother Nature's fabric.  Unlike Mother Nature’s cloth, which was strong resilient and pliable, the cloth  produced by man was weak and seemed to tear with the slightest strain.</div>
		<div>In desperation the man approached Chance and asked, "How did you and Mother Nature produce such splendid tapestries?  I've tried everything I know and all I get are reams of this.”  He held up a handful of his latest creation in disgust."Silly man," said Chance.  "Mother Nature and I do not weave the cloth we just help it emerge from the loom.  You can not be the weaver of the cloth the cloth weaves itself.  All you can do is help."
"I don't understand," said the Man."No,” smiled Chance.  "It's not something to be understood."The End</div>
